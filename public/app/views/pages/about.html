    Solar, Water Pump.
    A solar water pump has a mini power house at its heart and consists of a calibrated and matching solar array of modules â€“ tuned with the equivalent power of pump for that particular application. The solar water pumping system is capable of running all types of electrical water pumps with applications varying from irrigation to household demands. Irrigation pumps such as submersible, surface or deep well can also be coupled with drip irrigation systems to enhance the returns from this configuration.</p>

    Each solar array has a number of solar modules connected in parallel or series. Every solar PV panel generates current by converting solar radiation to electrical energy.

    The electrical energy from the entire array is controlled, tuned and directed by the inbuilt controller in DC pumps or through the Variable Frequency Driver(VFD) and enables the connected pump (may be submersible or surface) to draw water and feed the delivery pipelines.

    The water thus drawn from ponds, rivers, bore wells or other sources by a solar water pump is pumped to supply water as required. It can be stored in tanks from where it is later channelled to fields or the supply from the pump may be coupled with drip irrigation systems to provide optimised water to fields directly.
